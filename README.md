## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay: Eat food to grow longer and increase your score!
- Simple controls using the arrow keys.
- Game resets when the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.
- High score tracking to challenge your skills!

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
cd snake-game
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. This project uses the built-in Turtle module, so no additional libraries are required.

## How to Play

1. Run the game using the command:

   ```bash
   python snakegameproject.py
   ```

2. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:
   - **Up Arrow**: Move Up
   - **Down Arrow**: Move Down
   - **Left Arrow**: Move Left
   - **Right Arrow**: Move Right

3. Try to eat the blue food to grow your snake and increase your score!
4. Avoid running into the walls or your own tail. If you do, the game resets!

## Game Logic

- The snake starts with a length of three segments and grows longer with each food item consumed.
- The game checks for collisions with the walls and the snake’s own body.
- The score is updated and displayed at the top of the window, along with the high score.

## A Little Humor

Why did the snake cross the road?  
To eat the chicken on the other side! 🐍😂

## File Organization

Make sure all your project files are organized in a single folder. Your project directory should look like this:

```
snake-game/
├── snakegameproject.py
├── snake.py
├── food.py
├── scoreboard.py
└── data.txt  # This file will be created when you run your game, no need to create it yourself.
```

This structure ensures the game runs smoothly without any issues finding the necessary modules and data.

Enjoy playing the **Nostalgic Snake Game** and may your snake grow ever longer! 🐍🎮
